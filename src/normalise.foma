# ==========
# This script gets as input html code, and returns the text that is included in
# paragraph tags. This has been found to suit many online newspaper formats, in
# particular the [Times of Malta](timesofmalta.com) and [El Pa√≠s](elpais.com),
# which are the sources for this assignment's text (in English and Spanish,
# respectively).
#
# HTML parsing is a non-trivial issue, and even simple cases as text extraction
# are full of corner cases and difficult to solve issues. For a critical
# component, a parser which understands the DOM structure should be used.
# However, a reasonable job can be done for this assignment, especially with the
# clear and easy formatting of online newspapers.

# HTML paragraph start and end tags.
define start "<" p ">";
define end "<" "/" p ">";
define tag start|end;

# First we delete everything that is not a paragraph.
define onlyPars [[start ~tag end]] .P. [?* -> 0];

# Then we clean tags and html special codes.
define noTags "<" ?* ">" @> " ";
define noEnts "&" ?* ";" @> " ";
