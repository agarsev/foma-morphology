# Spanish Fallback
# ================
# This script provides a series of fallback transducers that try to tag unknown
# entities in the input.

# If a word in Spanish ends in _mente_, it's almost certainly an adverb `Adv`.
regex ?* {mente} "+Adv":0;

# A lot of adjectives (`Adj`) related to a process end in an _l_, and it's not a common
# ending for other types of words.
regex ?* l "+Adj":0;

# Noun (sustantive, `Sust`) morphology in Spanish is quite regular, so _o_ and
# _a_ endings usually denote gender, and an _s_ is often a plural marker.
regex ?* [o "+Masc":0 |a "+Fem":0] ["+Sing":0|"+Plural":s] "+Sust":0;

# Another option is a noun that ends in a consonant, then it's usually
# pluralized with an _es_ morpheme.
define Cons [b|c|d|f|g|h|j|k|l|m|n|Ã±|p|q|r|s|t|v|w|x|y|z];
regex ?* Cons 0:e "+Plural":s "+Sust":0;

# If we can't detect the gender and number of the word, just mark it as a plain
# noun.
regex ?* "+Sust":0;
